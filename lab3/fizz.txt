# analogous to the smoke.txt but above to the return address we set seventh argument to the procedure fizz()
# but in order to do this we must skip the 8 bytes (filled by 77 77 77 ..... in this case) because in the moment
# control being passed to the fizz(), %rsp points to the adrress just above the overwritten return address 
# and this 8 bytes (filling by 77 77 77 ... ) simulates the return address to which control should be passed
# after returning from fizz()
